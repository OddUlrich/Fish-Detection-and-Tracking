# Fish detection and tracking

## Overview



## Dataset
The files in each .zip file consider the root repository as "data/" by default. Therefore, before using these data for training, they are all required to be extracted into a repository named "data", inspite of the issue that no file is found.

**Note**: In the future work, a proper way to process different datas as a whole is required, because all .zip files consists of files that have the same names.
